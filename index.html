                    <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mb-4">May 2022</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300">I developed a real-time virtual apparel simulator using a Kinect sensor to create an interactive dressing room experience. The system captures a user’s body movements and overlays 3D-rendered clothing onto their live image, allowing them to virtually try on different outfits without physically changing. By leveraging depth sensing, motion tracking, and computer vision, the simulator provides a seamless and engaging shopping experience. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate human-computer interaction, 3D simulation, and sensor technologies to build innovative solutions with applications in retail, fashion tech, and immersive customer experiences.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mb-4">April 2025</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300">Ploonty – Smart Plant was developed during an NJIT Hackathon, where our team designed a system that takes the stress out of plant care. Equipped with soil moisture sensors and a rainwater reservoir, Ploonty doesn’t just tell you when your plant is thirsty — it waters it automatically using stored rainwater. With IoT-based remote monitoring, it provides peace of mind and sustainability by reducing water waste. This project reflects my ability to ideate, prototype, and deliver functional IoT solutions under time constraints, while combining automation, sustainability, and user experience into one cohesive product.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mb-4">May 2025</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300"> As part of the CPE‑556 course, I developed multiple embedded systems applications using the B‑U585I‑IOT02A development board. Projects included a smart home monitoring system with IoT-enabled sensors for temperature, humidity; and a home security system using an ultrasonic sensor and a 4×4 matrix keypad. These projects demonstrate my ability to design, program, and integrate embedded hardware with software, handle sensor data acquisition, and implement real-time system control while showcasing practical IoT applications.</p>
